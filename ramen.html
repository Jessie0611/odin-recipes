    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skin on Chicken Breast </li>
    <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 tsp ssesame or veg oil</li>
    <li>2 tsp minced ginger</li>
    <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
    <li>3 tbsp low sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
    <li>4 cups rich chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 oz dried shitake mushroom</li>
    <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup scalloions, sliced</li>
    <li>2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
    <li><em>optional: fresh jalapeno or chili slices</em></li>
    
</ul>

<h1>Instructions</h1><br>
<h2>Chicken</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li><br>
    <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, <br> and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. 
        <br> Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.</li><br>
    <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.<br>
         Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li><br>
</ol>
<h2>Ramen Broth</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, 
        <br> and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. 
        <br> Cook for another minute.</li><br>
    <li>Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, 
        <br>then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Soft Boiled Egg</h2>
<ol>
    <li>ill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs 
        <br>(still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes
        <br> (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yolk).</li><br>
    <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to 
        <br>the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough 
        <br> to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. 
        <br>Set aside until ready to serve.</li><br>
</ol>

<h2>Assembling the Bowl</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. 
        <br>When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.</li><br>
    <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. 
        <br> Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño, 
        <br>and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!</li>    
</ol>
